Simpli5 is an HTML5 Javascript library. What this means is that we do away with much of the code that is used for cross-browser compatibiltiy and workarounds for non-compliant browsers. This also means that this library will not work for gerneral public apps until most browsers support HTML5.

Meant to be used for HTML AIR applications, mobile device applications, or applications where you tell your users to grow up and get a big-boy browser. ;)
